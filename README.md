# Tiles memory game

Welcome to my simple memory game created using HTML5, CSS and Javascript! This is a 
short yet effective way at putting your brain to the test. Within the game, there are 
different difficulties to choose from. This allows players to enjoy the game at an 
intensity level that suits their own gaming style.

I want players to have a hassle free experience on my site when dealing with playing, 
navigating or sending support emails. Creating a full list of instructions, call to 
action buttons and a simple yet effective form with Javascript has made this all possible
